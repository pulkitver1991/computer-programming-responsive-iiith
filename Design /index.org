* Introduction
  This document captures a high level design of using the keyword search
  service for a lab and experiment to fetch out the videos related to it.

* Process

** Set up the environment to use the service
   1. To use the service in fetching the url for videos for a lab and
      experiment, we need to run the keyword search service.
   2. To run the service, follow the link to set up the service:
      [[https://github.com/vlead/nptl-data-service/blob/develop/src/deployment/index.org][nptl-data-service]]

** Check whether the service is working 
   1. While the above is running, Open a new terminal.
   2. Clone the repository for a lab, for e.g. [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/computer-programming-responsive-iiith/tree/nptel][Computer-Programming]] lab.
   3. Navigate to the exp1
      -cd /local-cloned-path/computer-programming-responsive-iiith/src/lab/exp1
   4. Open index.html in firefox.
   5. Go to Video tab.
   6. If everything is fine, you will find videos related to the experiment.
   7. One can now use the related videos.
